# Scholarships:
- [Open Doors](https://od.globaluni.ru/)
    - This is actually an Olympiad, since you still need additional testing, but it's referred to by everyone as a "scholarship" so it'd make more sense to put it here.
- [Russian Government Scholarship](https://education-in-russia.com/)
- Some universities like [HSE](https://admissions.hse.ru/en/) or [Innopolis](https://apply.innopolis.university/en/bachelors/) provide grants for international applicants that pass entrance exams (conducted online).
