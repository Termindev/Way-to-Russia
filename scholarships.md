# Scholarships:

- [Open Doors](https://od.globaluni.ru/)
  - This is actually an Olympiad, since you still need additional testing, but it's referred to by everyone as a "scholarship" so it'd make more sense to put it here.
- [Russian Government Scholarship](https://education-in-russia.com/)
- Some universities like [HSE](https://admissions.hse.ru/en/) or [Innopolis](https://apply.innopolis.university/en/bachelors/) provide grants for international applicants that pass entrance exams (conducted online).
- [Saint Petersburg State University](https://cabinet.spbu.ru/) offers an application process similar to [Russian Government Scholarship](https://education-in-russia.com/), with the exception that all documents (passport, transcripts) should be translated to Russian, and those who wish to apply to bachelor's taught in Russian have to take a free online exam in Russian (B1 level), if they choose a program in English, they'd take an exam in English (B1 level) and an exam in Russian (A1 level).

Check [their website](https://abiturient.spbu.ru/en/info/government-funded-basis/) for more information.
