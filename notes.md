# What and How?
This document includes Olympiads where international students can participate, most of the data here is from google searching, emailing and mainly the site of the Olympiad itself, if you notice any mistakes, feel free to contact (Contact information below).

You should use this document as a quick reference to check the olympiads that suit you and start preparing for them, it is recommended to also do extra research since there's many semi-online (read [olympiad formats](#olympiads-sorted-by-format)) made by universities that weren't included here, however I tried to include all and every olympiad I encounter during my research, and it'd be appreciated if you help with this document as well.

# Olympiads sorted by format
## Fully online:
Olympiads which you can participate in fully remotely, without having to travel.
## Fully offline:
For this one, you have to travel to participate in ALL stages of the Olympiad.
## Semi-online:
This way this works (usually) is there's a qualification round(s) held online, and the finals are held offline (in-person).


# Brief description of each Olympiad:
### Notes for this section:
Some data here might be outdated, especially for the fact that some dates aren't released yet, so I've based them on the dates of the previous version of the Olympiad, it's better to double check the information on the website itself, this is more of an overview than a reference, it's so you can be familiar with them, if you're going to participate **use the information in the site, not the information here**.

Anything that has a question mark (**?**) indicates that this is either not listed on the site or I wasn't sure about it, so to not mislead people, I left a question mark which means you have to do your own research for this one (usually you just need to send an email).

Something I also have to include is what's the difference between a winner and a prize winner, in-short a winner is first place, and a prize winner is any other placement (2nd or 3rd etc).

Some competition only have one winner and prize winners are only two (2nd and 3rd place) such as [ИТМО](https://ec.itmo.ru), others allow multiple winners and prize winners such as [HSE MOM](https://olymp.hse.ru/inter/), to know whether a competition allows multiple winners/prize winners, check the results (if they're published publicly).

## Not included
Here's a list of Olympiads I didn't include, for the reasons listed:
#### Is it possible for students from Egypt to participate?
These are named "International" but I'm not sure if they really mean it

https://mendeleevolympiad.org/en

https://olimpiada.ru/activity/5392

https://olimpiada.ru/activity/5420

https://olimpiada.ru/activity/5795
#### What..
https://olymp.mephi.ru/rosatom/about

https://vsesib.nsu.ru/

https://cmo.adygmath.ru/en/node/233

https://inter-olimp.mil.ru/

https://mpei.ru/news/Pages/adItem.aspx?adID=2430

These all have one thing in common, their sites don't make much sense, there is information in some of them but it wouldn't make sense to include it in, write the dates and leave everything else as question marks.

Lastly this: https://olymp.hse.ru/ma/, this wasn't included because this document focuses mainly on bachelor's programs, while this is for master's.
